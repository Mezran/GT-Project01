            <hr>
            <span>Abilities are special effects, powers, or behaviors found on cards. For spell cards, the ability
                describes the total effect of playing that card, while for minion and weapon cards, abilities are
                special effects or powers additional to the basic functions of the card. Abilities may be described in
                the card's text, or granted by enchantments.</span>
